# A Landing Page for Fylo

This project is a way of encouraging people to use css grid features to create dynamic layout.

CSS grid is a game changer, It replaces float layout, and allows you to write less and more readable and logical HTML/CSS. It also works perfectly together with flexbox, which is best to handle one-dimensional components and layout.

This project is open to contributions!
